		<p>Aaron and Bria Colyer found out they were pregnant with their
			second child August 3rd, 2014. Bria had a rough pregnancy struggling
			with hyper emesis (severe nausea) that lead to her having to take a
			leave of absence from her part time job in October. She had to have
			IV fluids at home every day for 4 months, along with taking 3
			different anti-nausea medicines. When Bria was 30 weeks pregnant she
			started having back and chest pain, along with steady Braxton hicks
			contractions, and there was a significant decrease in movement from
			the baby. Her OBGYN scheduled an ultrasound when she was 31 weeks and
			5 days and they discovered that the umbilical cord wasn't working and
			that Baby wasn't doing very well.</p>

		<p>Aaron and Bria rushed to the hospital where they met with the
			high risk doctor and nurses and upon further testing they discovered
			that Bria had A-typical Preeclampsia and her liver was shutting down.

		<p>On February 13th, 2015 Bo Daniel was born via emergency
			C-section weighing 2 lbs 14 ounces and he spent the first 70 days in
			the NICU. While in the NICU the doctors discovered that Bo's right
			kidney doesn't drain of urine when he urinates but rather fills back
			up, and his left kidney has a blockage. He is prone to getting UTI's
			due to this and has to be on a daily dose of amoxicillin, on top of
			other medications and vitamins. In November, Bo and his parents head
			back to the University of Iowa for a second time to find out if he
			has to have surgery to repair his right kidney. Bo's digestive system
			is also still immature so he struggles with chronic stomach pain that
			at times prevents him from being able to eat. Like a lot of children
			who have spent a lot of time with doctors, going in to get a simple
			weight check proves to be very stressful for Bo, and he struggles the
			rest of the day after his appointment.</p>

		<p>While he is doing well, Bo still has a long journey ahead of
			him for the next 2 years, one full of doctor appointments, therapy
			appointments, and possible life- long need of medication;
			nevertheless he has proven to be quite the fighter that is quick to
			smile and loves to cuddle.</p>
